## How to start

Get sources:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Ayvan/docker-ninjam.git
$ cd docker-ninjam
```

Generate new passwords:
```bash
$ ./passwords.sh
```

After generating, this script prints passwords to console. Please, save you passwords in secure place.

Set your server hostname and email for Let's Encrypt request:
```bash
$ ./hostname.sh YOURSERVER.COM YOUR-EMAIL@SOMEMAIL.COM
```

Generate RSA keys for JWT token authentication (for DJ bot API) manually or run script:
```bash
$ ./jwt_rsa_keys.sh
```

RSA keys must be placed in /etc/ninjam directory and file names must be private.pem and public.pem

Create user dj, and user home dir, and tracks dir:
```
useradd dj && mkdir /home/dj && chown dj:dj /home/dj && mkdir /home/dj/tracks && chown dj:dj /home/dj/tracks
```

Copy configs and web files (for example, you can use another path to configs, but you need to change it in start command too):
```bash
$ sudo cp -R icecast2 /etc/icecast2
$ sudo cp -R ninjam /etc/ninjam
$ sudo cp -R ninjam-web /var/www/ninjam-web
```

You can edit your configs and web files manually. For example, you can update HTML in index.php file
(change favicon.ico, page logo or any text on page), add new users in ninjam2050.cfg and ninjam2051.cfg files etc. 

Build docker container:
```bash
$ ./build.sh
```

Start:
```bash
$ /usr/bin/docker run -t -a stdout --rm -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 2050:2050 -p 2051:2051 -p 8000:8000 -v /home/dj/tracks:/home/dj/tracks -v /etc/ninjam:/etc/ninjam -v /etc/icecast2:/etc/icecast2 -v /var/www/ninjam-web:/app/src/public ninjam-server:latest
```

To autostart server you can use supervisord config file jam.conf

### How to enable HTTPS?

HTTPS is automatically enabled. Just set your email and domain for Let's Encrypt by hostname.sh script, and it automatically generates certificate for HTTPS.
